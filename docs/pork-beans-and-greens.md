# Pork, beans, and greens

I first made this recipe on October 4th, 2021 after getting some tips from Zack's mom on her lima beans and ham hocks recipe. Adjust it as you wish, it is a very flexible dish!

## Ingredients

This recipe details making two pots of beans, one with ham hocks, and one without.

### For each of two pots

- One onion each: Roughly chopped
- Four cloves garlic each: Halved and green bits removed. You can mince if you like, but I like half-cloves just tossed in
- Three bunches collards: Ribbed, washed thoroughly, wrapped in paper towels until ready to prep. Unwrap, roll into cigars, and chop into ribbons
- About two quarts stock per pot (enough to cover contents by an inch)
  - E.g. two quarts chicken stock, or water with 8 oz of frozen concentrated stock cubes (4 2-oz pucks or 8 standard icecubes)
  - E.g. two quart cartons veggie broth

### For the meat pot

- Two smoked ham hocks
- One smoked pigs ear (optional)
- 1 lb neck bones (fresh, not smoked, optional)

### To serve

- White or wild rice (Lundberg, etc)
- Kosher salt, pepper, hot sauce, red/sherry vinegar

### The day before

This prep can be done the day before or further in advance.

#### Homemade chicken stock (optional)

Skip this step if using store-bought stock. I save chicken parts and bones over time, adding parts to a gallon bag in the freezer. It's fine to put cooked as well as fresh bones in the freezer bag. Once the gallon bag of chicken bones, necks, wing tips, etc. is almost full, it's time to make the stock!

Put the bones in a pot. Add a roughly-chopped onion, a carrot or two, and a celery rib or two (you can skip the celery if you won't be using the rest of the bunch). Put in two teaspoons whole peppercorns, one teaspoon whole coriander, and one teaspoon fennel seeds. You can toss in cheese rinds as well. Cover with water and simmer for four to six hours. Cool, strain, toss the solids.

##### Stock ingredients

- Gallon of chicken bones and parts
- Onion
- Carrot or two
- Celery rib or two
- Whole peppercorns
- Whole coriander
- Fennel seed
- Parm rind (optional)

#### Prep the fresh meat (if using)

If you're using fresh neck bones, lay them out on a platter and scatter kosher salt and pepper liberally over both sides. Let them sit in the fridge overnight while the beans soak. Smoked meats do not need any additional salt or prep time.

#### Soak the beans

Empty the 2 lbs of butter beans into a one-gallon bowl. Pick out the ugly/split ones. Put 1/4 cup of kosher salt in the bowl. Fill with water. Soak for at least eight hours, and up to a day. Zack's mom says you can get away with just a couple hours soaking, too.

### The day of

Cook the wild rice. I like using chicken stock (or half a frozen stock puck in the water) and a tablespoon of butter to 1 cup dry wild rice. It will take about an hour to cook.

Pour the bean brine out and dump beans in a colander. Rinse gently, separate into two portions for two Dutch ovens.

Cook down the onions a bit with some vegetable oil, don't let them brown too much. Put the garlic in and cook briefly. Season to taste what you have so far with salt, pepper, and any other spices. I used some cumin and chipotle chile powder in this step one time.

Put the beans in the pot, then nestle all the pork items in. Cover with water or stock (add concentrate cubes if using). Taste the broth and salt as needed. For the meatless stew, consider pouring over about a half cup of EVOO to cap the pot of beans as they cook. Bring both pots to a simmer, cover simmer for a half hour.

Check the beans, they will still be tough. Add the collards and simmer until done, for another half hour to an hour. Add more stock as needed to keep the beans and greens covered.

The beans are done when there is no significant resistance when biting through the skin of the bean, and the whole bean chews easily but doesn't totally fall apart. Try pressing a bean between your tongue and the roof of your mouth. If it gives easily, then it's done.

Since we added salt at every stage of cooking, we shouldn't need to add much (or any) salt at the end of cooking. By cooking the beans in appropriately-salted water the whole time, they should taste even better than if we salted only at the end.

You can pull the pig ear out at this point. Try letting it cool, chopping it up into thin strips, and eating with a sprinkle of salt and hot sauce. The tip of the ear and the fleshy part near the base are the best bits! Separate the rest of the bones out from the hocks and necks, and discard the bones.

Serve with rice and hot sauce, sherry/red vinegar, or some other acidic component.
