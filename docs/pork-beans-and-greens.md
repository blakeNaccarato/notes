# Pork, beans, and greens

I first made this recipe on October 4th, 2021 after getting some tips from Zack's mom on her lima beans and ham hocks recipe. Adjust it as you wish, it is a very flexible dish!

## Ingredients

This recipe details making two pots of beans, one with ham hocks, and one without.

### Total for meat and meatless pots

- Two onions: Roughly chopped
- Eight cloves garlic: Halved and green bits removed. You can mince if you like, but I like half-cloves.
- Three bunches collards: Ribbed, washed thoroughly, wrapped in paper towels until ready to prep. Roll and chop into ribbons when ready.
- Two quarts stock per pot
  - Or two quarts water with 6-8 homemade broth ice-cubes, or 3-4 homemade 2-oz frozen pucks.
  - Use about two boxes vegetable broth for the veggie pot

### For the meat pot

- Two smoked ham hocks (maybe three if omitting neck bones)
- One smoked pigs ear (optional)
- 1 lb neck bones (fresh, not smoked)
- Wild rice (Lundberg or equivalent)
- Kosher salt, pepper, and whatever other seasonings you like

### The night before

This prep can be done the night before or further in advance.

#### Make the chicken stock (optional)

Skip this step if using store-bought stock. I save chicken parts and bones over time, adding parts to a gallon bag in the freezer. It's fine to put cooked as well as fresh bones in the freezer bag. Once the gallon back of chicken bones, necks, wing tips, etc. is almost full, it's time to make the stock! Put the bones in a pot. Add a roughly-chopped onion, a carrot or two, and a celery rib or two (you can skip the celery if you won't be using the rest of the bunch). Put in two teaspoons whole peppercorns, one teaspoon whole coriander, and one teaspoon fennel seeds. If you use parmigiano-reggiano frequently, you can save the rinds in the freezer as well. Toss one parm rind in the stock. Cover with water and simmer for eight hours. You can use a slow cooker or Instant Pot, just simmer a couple hours longer because it takes a while for those things to warm up. When done, let the pot cool. Then strain out the solids and keep the liquids.

#### What you'll need for the homemade stock

- Gallon of chicken bones and parts
- Onion
- Carrot or two
- Celery rib or two
- Whole peppercorns
- Whole coriander
- Fennel seed
- Parm rind (optional)

#### Prep the fresh meat (if using)

If you're using fresh neck bones, lay them out on a platter and scatter kosher salt and pepper liberally over both sides. Let them sit in the fridge overnight while the beans soak. Smoked meats do not need any additional salt or prep time.

#### Soak the beans

Empty the bag of butter beans into a one-gallon bowl. Put 1/4 cup of kosher salt in the bowl. Fill with water. The beans are going to expand a lot at first, then a little more over time. You should try to soak them for at least eight hours, and up to twenty-four hours. Zack's mom says you can get away with just a couple hours soaking, too.

### The day of

Start cooking the wild rice. I like using chicken stock and a tablespoon of butter to 1 cup dry wild rice. It will take about an hour to cook. As for the beans, you will need at least an 8 qt pot. I have used two smaller pots if I don't have one big enough. Cook down the onions a bit with some vegetable oil, don't let them brown too much. Put the garlic in and cook briefly. Season to taste what you have so far with salt, pepper, and any other spices you like. I used some cumin and chipotle chile powder in this step, but I don't know how much it contributed to the overall dish in the end.

Put the beans in the pot, then nestle all the pork in. Cover with chicken stock. Taste the stock now, and add some more salt here as needed. For the meatless stew, consider pouring over about a quarter cup of EVOO to cap the pot of beans as they cook. Cover the pot and simmer for about one hour. Then put the collard greens in, and simmer for another hour or so. Add more stock as needed to keep the beans and greens covered. The beans are done when there is no significant resistance when biting through the skin of the bean, and the whole bean chews easily but doesn't totally fall apart. Try pressing a bean between your tongue and the roof of your mouth. If it gives easily, then it's done.

Since we added salt at every stage of cooking, we shouldn't need to add much (or any) salt at the end of cooking. By cooking the beans in appropriately-salted water the whole time, they should taste even better than if we salted only at the end. You can pull the pig ear out at this point. Try letting it cool, chopping it up into thin strips, and eating with a sprinkle of salt and hot sauce. The tip of the ear and the fleshy part near the base are the best bits! Separate the rest of the bones out from the hocks and necks, and discard the bones.

This dish tastes even better the next day, after the flavors have melded a bit in the fridge overnight. Top with hot sauce, sherry vinegar, or some other acidic component.
